# Joker

Soundcloud allows 180 mins of free uploads. That's enough for 3 albums.

The songs should be composed from material in the Lecture Videos. E.g.,
intervals of hamming distance between semantically and phonetically similar
phrases from ES/DE langauges. Or maybe extract learnings about Julia sets to
midi data an produce a song which provides insight into the information.

# Development

Push ableton live sets to GitHub (or GitLab depending on free tier LFS).

# Staging

Upload 1 minute of audio per day for 6 months. That's 180 mins.

# Production

Filter material from Staging based on feedback from listens and likes and
produce more polished versions released to a new account. For a total of 360
minutes of audio over 6 - 8 months. Three albums and enough room for extra
promo material. The only thing that's missing is the analytics data, which could
be researched from other streams like twitter.
